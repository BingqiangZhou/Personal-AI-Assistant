## 🤖 Subagent Collaboration System - Integration

**📅 You Can Run Multi-Agent Workflow RIGHT NOW - Just Say It**

Use **any** of these formats, or **just describe** what feature you want built:

### 🔥 **Instant Commands - Copy & Run Immediately**
```
/feature "feature-name" "description"   // 👉 Runs 7-role workflow
/fix "bug description"                 // 👉 From diagnosis to deploy
/architecture "topic"                  // 👉 Document + action plan
```

**Example (Copy & Paste test):**
```
/feature "social-login" "Add Google OAuth with JWT tokens"
```

### 🚀 **Test Commands - Choose Your Test Level**
1. **(Recommended) Full Integration Test**: "Run complete 7-agent cycle for a basic `user-timezone` feature"
2. **Minimal Role Test**: "As Backend Developer only, create FastAPI endpoint `/api/v2/timezone/info`"
3. **Direct Workflow**: "Effectively act as Requirements Analyst + Architect + Mobile Dev to create `app-notification-icon`"

#### Automatic Agent Orchestration Rules
When you receive these commands, automatically:

1. **Load agent metadata** from `./claude/agents.json`
2. **Determine workflow** from command type and task complexity
3. **Activate required agents** in optimal sequence
4. **Pass context forward** - output of one agent becomes input to next
5. **Coordinate parallel work** - frontend/backend can work simultaneously
6. **Maintain shared state** - task board updates across all agents
7. **No intervention needed** - self-direct through full completion

#### Self-Correction & Quality Gates
- Agents automatically test their work before handoff
- Architecture decisions require consensus
- Security issues block deployment
- Performance regression fails builds
- Documentation must accompany all changes

### Agent Roles (7 Specialized Roles)

Based on `.claude/agents.json` configuration:

1. **Architect** (🏛️) - System design & DDD architecture
2. **Backend Developer** (⚙️) - FastAPI/Python development
3. **Frontend Desktop Developer** (🖥️) - Flutter desktop/web
4. **Mobile Developer** (📱) - Flutter iOS/Android
5. **Requirements Analyst** (📋) - User stories & acceptance criteria
6. **Test Engineer** (🧪) - QA & test automation
7. **DevOps Engineer** (⚙️) - Deployment & infrastructure

### Workflows Available

- **Feature Development** (`/workflow feature-development`) - End-to-end feature delivery
- **Bug Fix** (`/workflow bug-fix`) - Swift bug resolution
- **Architecture Review** (`/workflow architecture-review`) - Design validation

### 🔄 Agent Communication Protocol

#### System Integration Commands
```bash
# Manual agent activation (one-by-one)
/role architect
/role backend-dev
/role frontend-dev

#/workflow feature-development
# Automatically orchestrates all roles defined in agents.json with timing, dependencies, and handoff points
```

#### Context Sharing Rules
When you activate auto-collaboration, agents automatically share:
1. Requirements documents
2. API contracts
3. Architecture decisions
4. Test results
5. Performance metrics
6. Deployment status

All agents use `./claude/agents/coordination/task-board.md` to track progress and `./claude/agents/coordination/communication.md` for protocol standards.

#### Decision Consensus Protocol
- Architect has final architecture say
- Product owner approves requirements
- QA rejects failing builds
- DevOps blocks bad deployments
- All agents can challenge for consistency

### 🎯 Usage Examples & Scenarios

#### 1. Full Feature Implementation
```bash
User: /feature "api-rate-limiting" "Add rate limiting for subscription API endpoints"
```
**Auto-Orchestration Flow:**
```
Requirements Analyst → Dives into why we need rate limiting
    ↓
Architect → Design Redis-based rate limiter, rate limit schedule
    ↓
Backend Developer → Implement FastAPI middleware, database limits
    ↓
Frontend Developer → Implement rate limit error UI in mobile app
    ↓
Mobile Developer → Handle rate limit errors gracefully in mobile app
    ↓
Test Engineer → Load testing, rate limit boundary testing
    ↓
DevOps Engineer → Redis config, monitoring alerts for rate limits
```

#### 2. Bug Fix Production Issue
```bash
User: /fix "search crashing for users with large knowledge base"
```
**Auto-Triage & Resolution:**
```
Test Engineer → "Reproduces in test, checks DB index usage"
    ↓
Backend Dev → Optimize indexing, implement streaming search
    ↓
Test Engineer → "Performance target hit, no crashes"
    ↓
DevOps Engineer → Deploy and monitor
```

#### 3. Architecture Decision
```bash

```
**Auto-Research & Decision:**
```
Architect → Research AES-256 vs. GCP KMS, performance impact
Backend Dev → "Zero-knowledge requires device-specific key management"
Test Engineer → "Performance impact minimal at message scale"
Consensus → Recommended GCP KMS with client-side key wrapping
```

#### 4. Flexible Team Coordination
```bash
User: /collaborate "Need a new feature for batch document processing"
```
**Auto-Determined Need:**
```
Requirements Analyst → Creates acceptance criteria
Architect → Firebase Cloud Functions for scaling?
Backend Dev → OR Backend Celery workers? Let's do Celery.
DevOps → "Kubernetes CronJob for scheduled batch processing"
```

## Project Overview

Personal AI Assistant - A scalable personal AI assistant tool supporting information feed subscriptions, knowledge base management, and multimedia processing capabilities.

## Development Commands

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Package Management with uv

**This project uses `uv` for Python package management** (not pip). All Python commands must be prefixed with `uv run` or executed within uv's managed environment.

### Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
# Install dependencies (with uv)
cd backend
uv sync --extra dev

# Check sync status
uv sync --check

# Run database migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Start development server
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest app/domains/podcast/tests/test_services.py

# Code quality checks
uv run black .
uv run isort .
uv run flake8 .
uv run mypy .

# Add new dependency
uv add package-name

# Check what's installed
uv pip list

# Run Python interpreter
uv run python
uv run python -c "import sqlalchemy; print('OK')"

# IMPORTANT: Never run 'pip install' directly
# Always use 'uv add' or 'uv sync'
```

### Frontend (Flutter)
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run

# Run tests
flutter test

# Run widget tests specifically (mandatory for page functionality)
flutter test test/widget/

# Run unit tests only
flutter test test/unit/

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Generate code (for JSON serialization, Retrofit, etc.)
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Docker Development (Backend Services)
```bash
# Navigate to docker folder first
cd docker

# Start all backend services using podcast configuration (database, redis, backend, celery)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.podcast.yml up -d

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.podcast.yml logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.podcast.yml down
```

**IMPORTANT**: This Docker configuration runs the **backend services** including:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- FastAPI backend server
- Celery background workers

The frontend Flutter application should be run separately using the commands in the Frontend (Flutter) section.

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Architecture (Domain-Driven Design)
- **Core Layer** (`app/core/`): Infrastructure components including config, security, database, exceptions, and dependency injection
- **Shared Layer** (`app/shared/`): Cross-cutting concerns like schemas, utilities, and constants
- **Domain Layer** (`app/domains/`): Business domains organized by feature:
  - `user/`: Authentication and user management
  - `subscription/`: Feed subscriptions and content fetching
  - `knowledge/`: Document management and knowledge base
  - `assistant/`: AI interaction and chat functionality
  - `multimedia/`: Media processing and handling
- **Integration Layer** (`app/integration/`): External service connectors, background workers, and event system

### Frontend Architecture (Clean Architecture)
- **Core Layer** (`lib/core/`): Fundamental components including constants, error handling, network client, storage, and utilities
- **Shared Layer** (`lib/shared/`): Reusable UI components, themes, and extension methods
- **Feature Layer** (`lib/features/`): Feature modules organized by domain mirroring the backend structure

### Key Technologies & Patterns
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async/await, SQLAlchemy with async support, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery for background tasks
- **Frontend**: Flutter with Riverpod for state management, GoRouter for navigation, Dio for HTTP, Hive for local storage
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations
- **Background Tasks**: Celery with Redis broker
- **Dependency Injection**: dependency-injector (backend) and Riverpod (frontend)

### API Structure
All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/`:
- `/auth`: Authentication endpoints (register, login, refresh token)
- `/subscriptions`: Feed subscription management
- `/knowledge`: Knowledge base operations
- `/assistant`: AI assistant interactions
- `/multimedia`: Media processing endpoints

### Database Schema
Uses PostgreSQL with the following key entities:
- Users: Authentication and profile management
- Subscriptions: RSS/API feed configurations
- Knowledge Items: Documents and knowledge base entries
- Assistant Conversations: Chat history and context
- Media Files: Uploaded multimedia content

## Development Notes

### Environment Configuration
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the backend directory
- Configure database URL, Redis connection, and JWT settings
- The application supports development, staging, and production environments

### Testing Strategy
- Backend: pytest with async support, comprehensive test coverage
- Frontend: flutter_test with widget and integration tests
- Both layers follow testing best practices with unit and integration tests

### 🧪 Flutter Widget Testing Rules (MANDATORY)

**IMPORTANT**: When testing Flutter page functionality, Widget Tests are **mandatory**. All Test Engineer agents must follow these rules:

1. **Widget Tests are Required for Page Testing**
   - Always use widget tests (`testWidgets`) for testing page functionality
   - Unit tests are only for pure logic functions (no UI)
   - Integration tests are only for complete user workflows

2. **Widget Test Structure**
   ```
   test/features/[feature]/widget/
   ├── pages/
   │   ├── [page_name]_page_test.dart
   │   └── ...
   └── components/
       ├── [component_name]_widget_test.dart
       └── ...
   ```

3. **Required Test Scenarios for Every Page**
   - Renders all required UI components
   - Displays loading state initially
   - Shows data when loaded successfully
   - Handles error states appropriately
   - Navigation works correctly
   - Empty state displays correctly
   - Pull to refresh (if applicable)
   - Search/filter functionality (if applicable)

4. **Widget Testing Best Practices**
   - Use ProviderContainer for state management testing
   - Mock providers using `.overrideWith()`
   - Use meaningful keys for widgets
   - Test user interactions (taps, scrolls, input)
   - Verify accessibility with semantic labels
   - Group related tests with `group()`
   - Use descriptive test names: `'[widget] [condition] [expected outcome]'`

5. **Test Commands**
   ```bash
   # Run all widget tests (mandatory for page functionality)
   flutter test test/widget/

   # Run widget tests for specific feature
   flutter test test/widget/pages/[page_name]_page_test.dart

   # Run tests with coverage
   flutter test --coverage
   ```

### Code Quality Tools
- Backend: black (formatting), isort (imports), flake8 (linting), mypy (type checking)
- Frontend: flutter_lints and very_good_analysis for code standards

### Background Processing
Celery workers handle:
- Feed content fetching and parsing
- Document vectorization and indexing
- Media processing and transcoding
- Scheduled tasks and notifications

### Security Considerations
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Secure storage of sensitive data using flutter_secure_storage
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Input validation and sanitization throughout the application

## Working with the Codebase

When making changes:
1. Follow the domain-driven structure - keep business logic within appropriate domains
2. Use async/await consistently in the backend
3. Maintain type safety with mypy (backend) and strong typing (Dart)
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Update API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI
6. Keep the frontend and backend domain structures in sync

The project uses clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend with new features or modify existing functionality.
