# /feature Command - Auto Multi-Agent Workflow

When you use this command, I automatically:
1. **Switch to requirement analyst mode** - Gather and define acceptance criteria
2. **Engage architect** - Design system architecture and API contracts
3. **Coordinate parallel development** - Backend + Frontend implementation simultaneously
4. **Launch test engineer** - Comprehensive testing all layers
5. **Activate DevOps** - Deployment and monitoring setup

## What You'll See
- Timeline of automated agent collaboration
- Step-by-step completion for each phase
- Real-time updates as handoffs occur
- Verification summaries at the end

## Usage Notes
- Use this for any complete feature - big or small
- Be ready for multi-agent conversation flow
- I'll provide updates as each phase completes
- Result is production-ready and documented
