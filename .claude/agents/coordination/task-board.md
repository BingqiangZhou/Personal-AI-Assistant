# Personal AI Assistant - Task Board

## Task Tracking System

This task board coordinates work between specialized agents in the Personal AI Assistant project. Each agent can view, claim, and update tasks within their domain expertise.

## Task Template

## Status Definitions

### Todo
- Task is ready to be started
- All dependencies are resolved
- Clear requirements defined
- Not yet assigned or agent hasn't started

### InProgress
- Agent is actively working on task
- Work has begun and is progressing
- Regular updates expected

### Review
- Implementation complete
- Ready for code review
- Needs testing/verification
- Awaiting feedback

### Blocked
- Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- External blockers (APIs, tools)
- Needs clarification/decision
- Escalated to lead agent

### Done
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed and approved
- Tests passing
- Documentation updated

## Assignment System

### Claiming Tasks
1. Check "Todo" tasks in your domain
2. Verify you have capacity and expertise
3. Comment: "Claiming this task" with ETA
4. Update status to "InProgress"

### Releasing Tasks
1. If unable to complete, update with reason
2. Return status to "Todo"
3. Add notes on progress made
4. Notify domain lead

### Hand-offs
- For cross-domain tasks, create subtasks
- Each domain agent claims their subtask
- Use dependencies to track relationships

## Workflow Process

### Daily Standup Format
```
Yesterday:
- Completed: [Task IDs]
- In Progress: [Task IDs with blockers if any]

Today:
- Starting: [Task IDs]
- Continuing: [Task IDs]

Blockers:
- [Describe any blockers and who is helping]
```
